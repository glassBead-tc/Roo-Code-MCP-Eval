# Stress Test Results: Fault Lines Discovered

## ‚ùå Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Database Schema Mismatch**

**Severity**: HIGH - Blocking evaluation runs  
**Issue**: AI observer tables missing from database schema

```
ERROR: relation "ai_observer_sessions" does not exist
```

**Root Cause**: The AI-native evaluation system uses additional tables that aren't in the current migration files.
**Impact**: Prevents any evaluation with AI observer features enabled.

### 2. **Missing xvfb Dependency**

**Severity**: HIGH - Blocking headless VS Code execution  
**Issue**: `xvfb-run` command not found in macOS environment

```
/bin/bash: xvfb-run: command not found
```

**Root Cause**: The evaluation system assumes Linux Docker environment with xvfb pre-installed.
**Impact**: Cannot run VS Code in headless mode for automated evaluations.

## üîç System Architecture Analysis

### MCP Integration Status

- ‚úÖ **MCP Benchmark Processor**: Present and configured for `exa` and `firecrawl` servers
- ‚úÖ **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Properly initialized with MCP span processing
- ‚úÖ **Task ID Mapping**: System supports both string and numeric task IDs for MCP correlation
- ‚ùå **AI Observer Integration**: Blocked by missing database tables

### Expected MCP Server Behavior

Based on code analysis:

1. System automatically captures spans from MCP servers `exa` and `firecrawl`
2. MCP servers are detected via `rpc.system` = "mcp" and `rpc.service` attributes
3. Task correlation happens through `mcp.task_id` attributes
4. **Question**: No evidence of explicit MCP server prompting - appears to rely on Roo Code's natural tool selection

## üö® Design Review Findings

### Database Schema Gaps

The current schema (`packages/evals/src/db/schema.ts`) lacks:

- `ai_observer_sessions` table
- `ai_insights` table
- `ai_recommendations` table
- `ai_anomalies` table

### Environment Configuration Issues

1. **Docker Dependency**: System expects Linux Docker environment
2. **VS Code Path**: Hardcoded assumptions about `xvfb-run` availability
3. **Socket Path**: Uses `/tmp/roo-code-eval.sock` but task-specific paths differ

### MCP Server Selection Analysis

**Current State**: System appears to rely on **passive monitoring** rather than **active prompting**

- MCP spans are captured **after** tool usage occurs
- No evidence of system explicitly directing Roo Code to use MCP servers
- Relies on Roo Code's autonomous tool selection behavior

## üìä Performance Characteristics Observed

### Startup Sequence

1. ‚úÖ Database connection: ~500ms
2. ‚úÖ OpenTelemetry initialization: ~1s
3. ‚ùå AI observer initialization: **FAILED** (missing tables)
4. ‚ùå VS Code launch: **FAILED** (missing xvfb)

### Resource Usage

- Memory: Normal startup (~200MB)
- CPU: Initial spike during OTEL setup
- Network: Not tested due to early failures

## üéØ Critical Path Forward

### Immediate Fixes Required

1. **Add AI observer database tables** to schema and migrations
2. **Install xvfb or remove dependency** for macOS compatibility
3. **Test basic evaluation run** without AI features first
4. **Validate MCP trace capture** in simplified scenario

### MCP Integration Questions to Answer

1. Does Roo Code naturally choose MCP servers for relevant tasks?
2. Are OpenTelemetry traces properly capturing MCP interactions?
3. Do we need explicit prompting for MCP usage or is passive detection sufficient?

## üìã Next Actions

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Blockers

- [ ] Generate missing AI database migrations
- [ ] Fix VS Code execution environment
- [ ] Run basic evaluation without AI features

### Phase 2: Validate MCP Behavior

- [ ] Execute simple eval and observe MCP tool selection
- [ ] Analyze OpenTelemetry traces for MCP spans
- [ ] Test both explicit and implicit MCP usage patterns

### Phase 3: Performance Validation

- [ ] Full stress test with working environment
- [ ] Trace quality assessment
- [ ] End-to-end MCP integration verification

**Status**: Critical fault lines identified. System has solid foundation but missing key infrastructure pieces. MCP integration design appears sound but needs validation.
