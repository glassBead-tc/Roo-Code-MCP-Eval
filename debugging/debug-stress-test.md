# Debug Stress Test Workflow

## Overview

Time to debug at network speed. We have our system mapping - now we stress test the MCP evaluation system to find fault lines and validate our telemetry traces.

## Phase 1: Center and Prepare

1. **Review Capabilities**: Read through Anthropic docs in llms.md to center on current capabilities
2. **System State Assessment**: Confirm we understand what we built vs what exists
3. **Test Environment Setup**: Prepare for end-to-end evaluation run

## Phase 2: Stress Test Execution

1. **Basic Functionality Run**: Execute all system functionality top to bottom
2. **Evaluation Execution**: Run a complete eval to test the pipeline
3. **MCP Server Selection Analysis**:
    - Does Roo Code automatically choose to use MCP servers?
    - Do we need explicit prompting or does it decide naturally?
4. **Telemetry Trace Validation**: Verify we get good OpenTelemetry traces from MCP interactions

## Phase 3: Design Review Analysis

1. **Fault Line Detection**: Identify any breaking points or failure modes
2. **Decision Point Analysis**: Evaluate autonomous vs prompted MCP usage
3. **Trace Quality Assessment**: Confirm telemetry data completeness and usefulness
4. **Performance Characteristics**: Network speed debugging vs manual code review

## Expected Outcomes

- **Success Path**: Clean eval run with good MCP integration and traces → home stretch
- **Fault Detection**: Identify specific issues → write targeted workflow to fix them
- **Mixed Results**: Document what works vs what needs refinement

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Roo Code successfully integrates MCP servers during eval
- [ ] OpenTelemetry traces capture MCP interactions completely
- [ ] System operates at expected performance levels
- [ ] No critical fault lines discovered, or fault lines clearly documented for fixes

## Notes

This is both a debugging session and design review. The goal is network-speed analysis to either validate our architecture or identify specific areas needing attention before final implementation.
