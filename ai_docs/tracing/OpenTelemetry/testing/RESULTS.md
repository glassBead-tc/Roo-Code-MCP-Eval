# OpenTelemetry MCP Tracing Testing Plan Development - Process Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the process undertaken to develop a comprehensive testing plan for the OpenTelemetry tracing implementation in Roo Code's Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

## Research Phase

### 1. Understanding the Project Structure

**Tools Used:**

- `list_dir` to explore the monorepo structure
- `read_file` to examine configuration files

**Key Findings:**

- Roo Code is a complex monorepo with multiple packages
- Main extension code located in `/src/`
- VS Code extension with specific build and launch configurations
- Turbo-powered monorepo with workspace dependencies

### 2. VS Code Extension Development Documentation

**Process:**

- Used Context7 MCP server to fetch VSCode extension development documentation
- Query: "vscode extension development" against `/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples`
- Retrieved 5000 tokens of official Microsoft documentation

**Key Insights Discovered:**

- **F5 key** launches extension in development host window
- **npm run compile** builds the extension
- Extension development requires the "Extension Development Host" workflow
- Launch configuration available in `.vscode/launch.json`
- Build tasks configured in `.vscode/tasks.json`

### 3. Roo Code Development Workflow Analysis

**Files Examined:**

- `package.json` (root and `/src/`) - Build scripts and dependencies
- `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configuration
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build tasks
- Extension package.json configuration

**Development Process Identified:**

1. Use `npm run bundle` or turbo build commands
2. Launch with F5 from VS Code or "Run Extension" command
3. Extension opens in new "Extension Development Host" window
4. Watch mode available for continuous development

### 4. MCP Configuration Discovery

**Initial Misconception:**

- Found `.mcp.json` file in project root, initially assumed it was extension configuration
- User clarified this was a stray Claude Code config file, not part of Roo Code

**Actual MCP Configuration Analysis:**

- Used `codebase_search` to find MCP-related code
- Examined `src/services/mcp/McpHub.ts` for configuration patterns
- Found MCP servers are configured via:
    - Global settings file: `mcp_settings.json` in extension storage
    - Project-specific configurations
    - VS Code settings under `roo-cline` namespace

### 5. OpenTelemetry Implementation Review

**Implementation Details Found:**

- Event-based tracing pattern using Node.js EventEmitter
- `McpTraceManager` class handles span lifecycle
- Events: `mcp:tool:start`, `mcp:tool:success`, `mcp:tool:error`, etc.
- Integration points in `McpHub.callTool()` and other MCP operations

**Configuration Settings Discovered:**

- `roo-cline.telemetry.mcp.enabled` (boolean, default false)
- `roo-cline.telemetry.mcp.endpoint` (string, OTLP HTTP endpoint)
- `roo-cline.telemetry.mcp.useConsoleExporter` (boolean, for debugging)

## Testing Plan Development

### 1. Expected Behavior Analysis

**Span Patterns Identified:**

- Tool calls: `mcp.{serverName}.{toolName}`
- Connections: `mcp.connection.{serverName}`
- Resources: `mcp.resource.{serverName}`

**Attributes Schema:**

- OpenTelemetry RPC semantic conventions
- MCP-specific attributes (source, timeout, etc.)
- Performance metrics (duration, response size)
- Error handling with exception recording

### 2. Testing Strategy Design

**Phased Approach:**

1. **Development Setup** - Basic extension launch and verification
2. **Console Export Testing** - Immediate feedback with console output
3. **OTLP Export Testing** - External observability platform integration
4. **Error Handling** - Failure mode verification
5. **Performance Impact** - Overhead measurement
6. **Configuration** - Runtime setting changes

### 3. Test Environment Requirements

**Prerequisites Identified:**

- VS Code with extension development setup
- Node.js build environment
- Optional: Docker for local OpenTelemetry Collector/Jaeger
- MCP server configuration (user responsibility)

**Testing Tools:**

- VS Code Extension Development Host
- Browser Developer Tools for console inspection
- Jaeger UI for trace visualization
- VS Code settings interface

## Key Insights Gained

### 1. VS Code Extension Testing Patterns

From Microsoft documentation and project analysis:

- Extensions run in isolated development host
- F5 workflow is standard for extension development
- Build systems use esbuild and TypeScript compilation
- Watch mode enables iterative development

### 2. MCP Architecture Understanding

- Hub-based design with connection management
- Event-driven operation lifecycle
- Global vs project-scoped server configurations
- Tool approval and always-allow patterns

### 3. OpenTelemetry Integration Approach

- Non-invasive event-based pattern
- Configuration-driven activation
- Multiple exporter support (console, OTLP)
- Semantic convention compliance

## Testing Plan Deliverables

### 1. Comprehensive Test Plan (`TESTING_PLAN.md`)

**Contents:**

- Step-by-step testing procedures
- Expected trace output formats
- Success criteria definitions
- Troubleshooting guidelines
- Manual testing checklist

**Key Features:**

- Phased testing approach
- Console and OTLP export verification
- Error condition testing
- Performance impact assessment
- Configuration change validation

### 2. Process Documentation (`RESULTS.md`)

**Purpose:**

- Knowledge transfer for future maintainers
- Research methodology documentation
- Tool usage examples for similar tasks

## Tools and Techniques Used

### MCP Servers Utilized

1. **Context7** - Documentation retrieval from Microsoft VSCode samples
2. **Codebase Search** - Semantic search within Roo Code project
3. **File Operations** - Reading configurations and source code
4. **Directory Exploration** - Understanding project structure

### Research Methodology

1. **Top-Down Analysis** - Started with project overview
2. **Documentation-First** - Consulted official VSCode extension docs
3. **Code Investigation** - Examined implementation details
4. **Configuration Discovery** - Found settings and integration points
5. **Testing Strategy** - Designed comprehensive verification approach

## Recommendations for Testing Execution

### For Developers

1. **Start with Console Export** - Provides immediate feedback
2. **Use Simple MCP Server** - Reduces variables during initial testing
3. **Enable Detailed Logging** - OpenTelemetry SDK provides debug output
4. **Test Error Conditions** - Verify span error recording

### For CI/CD Integration

1. **Automated Build Verification** - Ensure extension compiles
2. **Unit Tests for Trace Manager** - Test event handling logic
3. **Integration Tests** - Mock MCP operations with tracing
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - Monitor overhead in CI

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

1. **Trace Sampling** - Reduce overhead in high-volume scenarios
2. **Custom Attributes** - Add user-specific metadata
3. **Trace Correlation** - Link MCP operations to user actions
4. **Metrics Integration** - Complement traces with performance metrics

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Production Deployment** - Gradual rollout with monitoring
2. **User Feedback** - Collect experience reports
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Track overhead in real usage
4. **Error Analysis** - Use traces for debugging user issues

## Conclusion

The testing plan development process successfully combined:

- Official Microsoft VSCode extension documentation
- Deep analysis of Roo Code's MCP implementation
- OpenTelemetry best practices
- Practical testing methodology

The resulting plan provides a comprehensive approach to validating the OpenTelemetry MCP tracing implementation, ensuring both functionality and performance meet production requirements.
