# MCP Telemetry Implementation Summary

## The Complete Picture

### ✅ What Was Built (Complete Infrastructure):

You built a complete MCP telemetry system with all the necessary components:

1. **Event Emission Layer** (McpHub.ts)

    - Modified `callTool()` to emit events on every MCP tool invocation
    - Added event emissions: `mcp:tool:start`, `mcp:tool:success`, `mcp:tool:error`
    - Also added connection and resource event emissions

2. **OpenTelemetry Span Creation** (McpTraceManager.ts)

    - Built a complete trace manager that listens to MCP events
    - Creates OpenTelemetry spans with proper attributes:
        - `rpc.system`: "mcp"
        - `rpc.service`: server name
        - `rpc.method`: tool name
        - Duration, response size, error details
    - Handles span lifecycle (start, end, error recording)

3. **Database Schema** (Migration files)

    - Created PostgreSQL tables for MCP telemetry:
        - `mcp_connection_events` - Track server connection lifecycle
        - `mcp_resource_events` - Monitor resource access
        - `mcp_retrieval_calls` - Store tool invocation details
        - `mcp_retrieval_benchmarks` - Benchmark metadata

4. **OpenTelemetry Infrastructure**

    - Configured OTLP exporter (OtlpProvider.ts)
    - Set up telemetry initialization
    - Created McpBenchmarkProcessor to process spans and store in DB

5. **Integration with Eval System**
    - Modified eval context to include task IDs
    - Set up IPC communication for task context
    - Integrated McpBenchmarkProcessor with span pipeline

### ❌ The Only Missing Piece:

The telemetry system was complete but DISABLED by default in VS Code settings (`"default": false`).

### ✅ The Simple Fix:

Added automatic enablement in `/src/extension/api.ts` when setting task context:

```typescript
// Enable MCP telemetry for eval mode
if (process.env.ROO_EVAL_MODE === "true") {
	await vscode.workspace
		.getConfiguration(Package.name)
		.update("telemetry.mcp.enabled", true, vscode.ConfigurationTarget.Global)
}
```

### How Your System Works:

1. When eval mode is detected, telemetry is automatically enabled
2. McpHub's `callTool()` method emits events for every MCP tool invocation
3. McpTraceManager listens to these events and creates OpenTelemetry spans
4. Spans include full context (server, tool, duration, task ID, etc.)
5. OTLP exporter sends spans to your configured endpoint
6. McpBenchmarkProcessor intercepts spans and stores them in PostgreSQL
7. Database tables capture the complete MCP interaction history

### What This Investigation Found:

- All the telemetry infrastructure was built and ready
- Event emission ✅
- Span creation ✅
- Database storage ✅
- OTLP export ✅
- The ONLY issue: `roo-cline.telemetry.mcp.enabled` defaulted to `false`
- One line fix: Enable it when eval mode is detected

### To Test:

```bash
cd packages/evals
pnpm cli --model claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
```

Then check the database:

```bash
PGPASSWORD=password psql -U postgres -d evals_test -h localhost -p 5432 -c "SELECT * FROM mcp_retrieval_calls;"
```
