# AI Agent Workflow Completion Issue Report

## Issue Summary

**Status:** Active Investigation  
**Component:** AI Agent Task Execution Pipeline  
**Environment:** MCP Telemetry Integration Fork

## Problem Description

AI agents in the MCP telemetry-enabled evaluation system consistently terminate at the analysis phase instead of proceeding to implementation, resulting in incomplete task execution despite successful setup and comprehensive problem analysis.

### Concrete Example - JavaScript "Two-Fer" Exercise

**Task Prompt:** _"Implement a function that returns 'One for [name], one for me.' or 'One for you, one for me.' if no name is provided"_

**Expected Output:**

```javascript
function twoFer(name) {
	return name ? `One for ${name}, one for me.` : "One for you, one for me."
}
module.exports = twoFer
```

**Actual Agent Behavior:**

```
‚úÖ Agent reads exercise requirements and existing files
‚úÖ Produces detailed analysis: "I need to implement a twoFer function that..."
‚úÖ Identifies test cases and edge conditions correctly
‚úÖ States: "I'll implement this by creating/modifying the function..."
‚ùå Immediately reports "Task completed successfully" without writing code
‚ùå Original placeholder file remains unchanged
‚ùå Tests continue to fail as no implementation was created
```

### Pattern Observed Across Multiple Exercises

**Languages Tested:** JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust  
**Exercise Types:** String manipulation, mathematical calculations, data structures  
**Consistency:** 100% reproduction rate across 15+ evaluation runs

**Typical Agent Analysis Output:**

```
"I can see this exercise requires implementing [X functionality].
The tests show I need to handle [Y edge cases].
I'll need to [detailed implementation approach].
Let me implement this solution..."

[TASK MARKED COMPLETE - NO IMPLEMENTATION FOLLOWS]
```

### Expected vs. Actual Behavior

**Expected Workflow:**

```
Task Start ‚Üí Analysis Phase ‚Üí Implementation Phase ‚Üí Completion
```

**Actual Workflow:**

```
Task Start ‚Üí Analysis Phase ‚Üí Premature Completion ‚ùå
```

## Technical Context

### System Architecture

The issue occurs within a complex distributed system:

- **VS Code Extension** running in headless Docker container
- **Evaluation CLI** with MCP telemetry integration
- **IPC Communication** between evaluation harness and extension
- **OpenTelemetry** distributed tracing across components
- **MCP Protocol** for telemetry data exchange

### Comparison with Reference Implementation

**Standard Roo Code (Working):**

- Simple IPC socket communication
- Direct task activation without telemetry overhead
- Straightforward completion criteria evaluation

**MCP Telemetry Version (Problematic):**

- Complex OpenTelemetry + MCP initialization
- Added AI observer integration and benchmark processing
- Enhanced telemetry hooks in task lifecycle

## Investigation Findings

### Infrastructure Status: ‚úÖ Confirmed Working

**Communication Layer:**

- IPC socket connection established successfully
- Messages transmitted correctly between CLI and extension
- Extension receives and acknowledges task commands

**Telemetry Pipeline:**

- MCP server integration functional
- OpenTelemetry spans created across workflow phases
- Distributed tracing captures agent decision points

**Environment Setup:**

- Docker container launches VS Code headless mode successfully
- Extension loads and activates properly
- API keys and configuration validated

### Workflow Analysis: üîç Under Investigation

**Analysis Phase Performance - Detailed Evidence:**

**CLI Log Output Example:**

```
[cli#runExercise | javascript / two-fer] üéâ TASK STARTED! AI agent activated successfully
[cli#runExercise | javascript / two-fer] ‚è≥ Waiting for AI agent activation...
[cli#runExercise | javascript / two-fer] taskEvent -> TaskStarted
[VS-CODE-EXT-LOG] [TASK-LOOP-DEBUG] Starting task loop for <taskId>
[VS-CODE-EXT-LOG] [COMPLETION-DEBUG] Task loop iteration completed: didEndLoop=false
[cli#runExercise | javascript / two-fer] taskEvent -> TaskCompleted
[cli#runExercise | javascript / two-fer] disconnect
```

**Agent Analysis Quality Examples:**

- **File Reading:** Successfully reads `two-fer.js`, `two-fer.test.js`, `package.json`
- **Test Comprehension:** Correctly identifies test cases expecting "One for Alice, one for me."
- **Implementation Planning:** States "I need to modify the twoFer function to return the correct string format"
- **Edge Case Recognition:** Notes the requirement for default "you" when name is undefined

**Implementation Phase Absence - Specific Evidence:**

**Tool Usage Logs:**

```
‚úÖ readFileTool: two-fer.js (successful)
‚úÖ readFileTool: two-fer.test.js (successful)
‚ùå writeToFileTool: NEVER INVOKED
‚ùå searchAndReplaceTool: NEVER INVOKED
‚ùå executeCommandTool: NEVER INVOKED
```

**Task Completion Telemetry:**

```json
{
	"taskCompleted": true,
	"toolUsage": {
		"readFileTool": { "attempts": 3, "failures": 0 },
		"writeToFileTool": { "attempts": 0, "failures": 0 }
	},
	"duration": 45000,
	"tokensUsed": 2847
}
```

**File State Verification:**

```bash
# Before agent execution
$ cat evals/javascript/two-fer/two-fer.js
function twoFer() {
  // TODO: implement the twoFer function
}

# After "successful" completion
$ cat evals/javascript/two-fer/two-fer.js
function twoFer() {
  // TODO: implement the twoFer function
}
# UNCHANGED - No implementation added
```

## Leading Hypotheses

### 1. Completion Criteria Misalignment (Primary Hypothesis)

**Theory:** The completion validation logic incorrectly identifies analysis as sufficient for task completion.

**Specific Evidence from Code Analysis:**

**Task.ts Completion Logic** (`src/core/task/Task.ts:1544-1551`):

```typescript
if (!didToolUse) {
	console.debug("[COMPLETION-DEBUG] No tools used - prompting for tool use or completion")
	this.userMessageContent.push({ type: "text", text: formatResponse.noToolsUsed() })
	this.consecutiveMistakeCount++
}
```

**Observed Log Pattern:**

```
[COMPLETION-DEBUG] Tool use analysis: didToolUse=false, messageContentBlocks=1
[NO-TOOLS-DEBUG] Model didn't use tools: taskId=<id>, assistantMessageContent=1
[COMPLETION-DEBUG] No tools used - prompting for tool use or completion
```

**Critical Discovery:** We identified a consistent issue where the agent completes analysis but skips implementation in the MCP telemetry fork, despite the same agent successfully implementing in the standard version.

**Investigation Path:**

- **Instrument `attemptCompletionTool.ts`** - Track when and why completion is triggered
- **Examine `formatResponse.noToolsUsed()`** - Verify the prompt correctly encourages implementation
- **Trace completion validation criteria** - Identify if analysis alone satisfies completion conditions

### 2. Tool Availability/Context Issues

**Theory:** Implementation tools may be unavailable or inappropriately configured in the current context.

**Specific Evidence from System Prompt Analysis:**

**Available Tools (confirmed in system prompt):**

```
- writeToFileTool: ‚úÖ Available and documented
- searchAndReplaceTool: ‚úÖ Available and documented
- executeCommandTool: ‚úÖ Available and documented
- readFileTool: ‚úÖ Successfully used by agent
```

**Observed Tool Usage Pattern:**

```
Analysis Phase: readFileTool ‚Üí Successful execution
Implementation Phase: NO TOOL INVOCATION ATTEMPTS
```

**Key Insight:** Implementation tools are never invoked during execution, suggesting either:

1. System logic fails to trigger implementation phase despite analysis completion
2. Different context/capability information is provided compared to standard version
3. Tool invocation is blocked by some condition not captured in logs

**Investigation Path:**

- **System prompt audit** - Verify tool availability is correctly communicated
- **Context capability inspection** - Check if MCP telemetry affects tool context
- **Execution trace analysis** - Examine why implementation tools are not invoked

### 3. Telemetry Initialization Interference

**Theory:** MCP telemetry setup disrupts timing-sensitive workflow state transitions.

**Specific Evidence from Initialization Sequence:**

**MCP Telemetry Initialization (extension.ts:99-105):**

```typescript
console.log("üöÄ [EXTENSION] About to initialize MCP tracing...")
const config = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("roo-cline")
const version = context.extension?.packageJSON?.version ?? "1.0.0"
initializeMcpTracing(config, version)
console.log("üöÄ [EXTENSION] initializeMcpTracing call completed")
```

**Timing Comparison:**

```
Standard Roo Code: Extension Load ‚Üí IPC Ready ‚Üí Task Start (< 2s)
MCP Telemetry: Extension Load ‚Üí MCP Init ‚Üí OpenTelemetry Setup ‚Üí
               AI Observer Init ‚Üí IPC Ready ‚Üí Task Start (5-8s)
```

**Potential Race Condition Evidence:**

```
[cli#runExercise] Setting task context...
[cli#runExercise] ‚úÖ Task context bypassed - trying direct StartNewTask
[EXTENSION] MCP telemetry initialization in progress...
[TASK-LOOP-DEBUG] Starting task loop for <taskId>
```

**Investigation Path:**

- **Sequence analysis** - Map exact timing of MCP initialization vs. task activation
- **State persistence check** - Verify telemetry doesn't interfere with task state management
- **Minimal reproduction without telemetry** - Test if removing MCP components resolves issue
