# MCP Telemetry Status Report

## Database Connection

‚úÖ PostgreSQL database is accessible at: `postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5432/evals_test`

## MCP Telemetry Tables

- ‚úÖ `mcp_retrieval_benchmarks` - **18 records**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `mcp_retrieval_calls` - **0 records**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `mcp_connection_events` - **0 records**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `mcp_resource_events` - **0 records**

## Recent Activity

Latest MCP benchmark entries:

- Most recent: 2025-06-08 19:55:38
- Server: `default_mcp_server`
- User Intent: `default_user_intent`

## Current Status

üü° **Partially Working**: The MCP telemetry system is creating benchmark records but not capturing:

- Individual MCP tool calls
- Connection events
- Resource access events

## Eval System Status

- Total runs: 5
- Total tasks: 250
- MCP benchmarks: 18

## Issue Summary

The eval system is running but Roo Code GUI is not appearing. MCP benchmark records are being created with default values, but the actual MCP tool execution telemetry is not being captured. This suggests:

1. The benchmark processor is working
2. But MCP telemetry.mcp.enabled may not be properly activated in the VS Code instance
3. Or the VS Code instance is running in a mode where MCP tools aren't being executed
