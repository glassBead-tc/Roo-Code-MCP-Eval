# Project Completion Strategy: Ulysses Protocol

**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Context**: MCP Evaluation System - Phase 2 Transition  
**Participants**: Ben & Resonance

## The Challenge

Ben has identified a critical pattern that threatens project completion:

1. **Optimization Bias**: Both human and AI tendency to iterate toward perfection rather than ship working solutions
2. **Throughput Mismatch**: AI can generate improvements faster than human can evaluate their necessity
3. **Historical Pattern**: Previous failures due to endless iteration cycles
4. **External Pressure**: SWE-Bench benchmark exists (discovered late), demo for Agentics Foundation in July
5. **Professional Stakes**: High visibility in professional community

## The Ulysses Principle

Like Odysseus hearing the Sirens' song, there are forces that will pull us toward attractive but potentially destructive paths:

- **Siren Songs for This Project**:

    - "Let's implement all the AI observer features first"
    - "We should fix the database schema completely"
    - "Maybe we should use SWE-Bench instead"
    - "This architecture could be so much better if..."
    - "One more iteration will make it perfect"

- **The Mast**: Pre-committed constraints to keep us on course
- **The Wax**: Deliberate ignoring of non-essential improvements

## Ben's Reasoning (Documented)

**Core Insight**: "I trust you, and I'm also a bad passenger seat driver"

**Key Concerns**:

1. AI systems tend toward improvement over completeness
2. Previous models "fuck this up before they had a chance to reason about it"
3. Unconscious avoidance of simpler solutions (SWE-Bench example)
4. Need to plan ahead to avoid optimization traps
5. Throughput mismatch makes it easy to generate more work than necessary

**Success Criteria**:

- Get MCP evaluation system working for Exa deadline
- Demonstrate MCP trace capture in practice
- Have something concrete to show at July Agentics Foundation demo
- Avoid endless iteration cycles that have failed before

## Proposed Protocol

### Phase 2a: Minimal Viable Fix (Tied to Mast)

**Goal**: Get AI agent activation working in Docker container
**Constraints**:

- No new features
- No architectural changes
- Fix only what's blocking basic evaluation
- Time box: [Ben to specify]

### Success Gate: One Working Evaluation

**Definition**: AI agent completes one exercise with MCP server usage detected
**Evidence**: Non-zero token usage, mcpServer field populated, file modifications

### Phase 2b: MCP Validation (Still Tied to Mast)

**Goal**: Confirm MCP servers are being used naturally
**Constraints**:

- Use existing infrastructure only
- Document behavior, don't optimize it
- Capture traces for analysis

### Phase 3: Demo Preparation (Wax in Ears)

**Goal**: Package working system for July presentation
**Constraints**:

- No new development
- Documentation and presentation only
- Resist all improvement suggestions

## Escape Clauses

**If we discover SWE-Bench integration is trivial**: Evaluate time cost vs benefit
**If fundamental architectural flaw discovered**: Stop and reassess rather than band-aid
**If external deadline changes**: Revisit constraints

## Ben's Authority

Ben has final say on:

- When to stop iterating
- Which improvements are essential vs nice-to-have
- Time allocation between phases
- Whether to pursue alternative approaches

Resonance commits to:

- Flagging when suggesting non-essential improvements
- Focusing on "does it work" over "is it optimal"
- Asking "is this necessary for the goal" before each suggestion

---

**Next Step**: Ben specifies time constraints and we execute Phase 2a with laser focus on AI agent activation only.
