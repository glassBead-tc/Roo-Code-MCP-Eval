# MCP Evaluation System Stress Test Summary

**Date**: June 10, 2025  
**Operator**: Resonance & Ben  
**Objective**: Validate MCP integration and identify system fault lines

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Status**: ‚úÖ Major breakthrough achieved - evaluation infrastructure works, critical gap identified

The stress test successfully validated that our Docker-based evaluation infrastructure is functional but revealed that Roo Code is not engaging with evaluation tasks. The MCP integration architecture is sound and ready, but the core AI agent activation needs investigation.

---

## üî¨ Test Results

### Infrastructure Validation ‚úÖ

- **Docker Environment**: Full working environment with VS Code, xvfb, all language runtimes
- **Database Connectivity**: PostgreSQL working, schema migrations successful
- **IPC Communication**: Socket connections established properly
- **Process Orchestration**: Task lifecycle management functional

### Critical Discovery ‚ùå

- **AI Agent Activation**: Roo Code not engaging with tasks (0 tokens used)
- **MCP Server Usage**: No MCP server calls detected (`mcpServer: null`)
- **Task Completion**: Exercise files remain unmodified, tests fail as expected

---

## üìä Detailed Findings

### Test Environment

```
Platform: Docker Linux container (node:20-slim base)
VS Code: 1.100.3 (successfully installed)
Display: xvfb working properly
Exercise: JavaScript binary conversion
Duration: ~37 seconds total
```

### Execution Flow

1. ‚úÖ Run creation successful (Run #19)
2. ‚úÖ Task creation successful (javascript/binary)
3. ‚úÖ VS Code launched with xvfb
4. ‚úÖ IPC socket connection established
5. ‚ùå AI agent never activated (0 token usage)
6. ‚úÖ Unit tests executed (failed as expected - no code changes)
7. ‚úÖ Cleanup and teardown successful

### Performance Metrics

## üö® Fault Lines Identified

### 1. **AI Agent Activation Issue** (CRITICAL)

- **Problem**: Roo Code extension not engaging with evaluation tasks
- **Evidence**: Zero token usage, no tool calls, no file modifications
- **Impact**: Blocks all evaluation functionality

### 2. **Database Schema Gaps** (HIGH)

- **Problem**: Missing AI observer tables (`ai_observer_sessions`, etc.)
- **Evidence**: DrizzleQueryError when AI features enabled
- **Impact**: Prevents AI-native evaluation features

### 3. **Environment Configuration** (MEDIUM)

- **Problem**: OpenRouter API key and configuration validation needed
- **Evidence**: No API calls detected despite proper IPC setup
- **Impact**: May be blocking AI agent activation

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Assessment

### What's Working ‚úÖ

- **MCP Benchmark Processor**: Ready to capture spans from `exa` and `firecrawl`
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Properly initialized and configured
- **Task ID Mapping**: System supports both string/numeric IDs for correlation
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Complete development environment
- **Process Management**: Robust task lifecycle with timeout handling

### What Needs Investigation ‚ùå

- **Roo Code Extension Activation**: Why isn't the AI agent starting?
- **API Configuration**: Is OpenRouter properly configured in container?
- **Prompt Injection**: Is the exercise prompt reaching the AI agent?
- **MCP Server Discovery**: Will Roo Code naturally find MCP servers?

## üé™ The Big Picture

This stress test achieved its primary goal: **revealing the exact failure point**.

We now know:

1. **Infrastructure is solid** - Docker, VS Code, IPC, database all work
2. **MCP integration is architecturally ready** - just waiting for AI agent activity
3. **Core issue is AI agent activation** - not MCP-specific problems

The question shifts from "Does MCP integration work?" to "Why isn't Roo Code engaging with tasks?"

---

## üöÄ Next Phase Recommendations

### Immediate (Phase 2a)

1. **Debug AI agent activation** - Check OpenRouter config, extension logs
2. **Validate prompt injection** - Ensure exercise prompts reach Roo Code
3. **Test manual Roo Code usage** - Verify extension works in container

### Follow-up (Phase 2b)

1. **Add missing AI database tables** - Enable AI observer features
2. **Run successful evaluation** - Get AI agent to complete a task
3. **Validate MCP behavior** - Observe natural vs prompted MCP usage

### Future (Phase 3)

1. **Full stress test** - Complete evaluation with MCP tracing
2. **Performance optimization** - Scale testing and optimization
3. **Production readiness** - Deploy to Exa evaluation pipeline

## üìù Technical Notes

- Git commit error at end is cosmetic (nothing to commit after cleanup)
- VS Code process detection shows proper container execution
- Unit test framework working correctly (jest, pnpm)
- Exercise structure and test files intact
- Socket paths and IPC messaging functional

---

**Status**: Ready for Phase 2a - AI agent activation debugging  
**Confidence**: High - clear path forward identified
