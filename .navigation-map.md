# Navigation Map - MCP AI Agent Activation - 2025-06-10

## üéØ MISSION: 4-Hour High Temperature Sprint

### Objective

Get AI agent to activate and complete ONE evaluation with MCP server usage detected

### Success Criteria (Essential Statistics)

- Non-zero token usage (tokensIn > 0, tokensOut > 0)
- mcpServer field populated (not null)
- File modifications in exercise directory
- Unit tests pass or meaningful attempt visible

### Reward Structure

‚úÖ **Complete Mission**: Access to git worktree + novel technology exploration
üî• **High Velocity Bonus**: If we exceed expectations, unlock optimization phase

### Time Box

- Start: 2025-06-10 12:45 PM
- Hard Deadline: 2025-06-10 4:45 PM
- Remaining: 4 hours 0 minutes

### Starting Position

- Branch: phase2a-ai-agent-activation
- Commit: 5a2083b04
- State: Docker evaluation runs, VS Code launches, but AI agent never activates (0 tokens)

### Path Hypothesis

AI agent activation failure likely due to one of:

1. OpenRouter API key not reaching extension in container
2. Extension not receiving/processing the task prompt correctly
3. IPC communication gap between CLI and extension
4. Extension configuration missing in container environment

### High Temperature Strategy

- Favor quick tests over deep analysis
- Accept "good enough" solutions
- Maximum 2 unexpected outcomes before backtrack
- Document reasoning for each step choice

## Decision Log

### Step 0: Baseline Established ‚úÖ

- Current state: Working infrastructure, non-working AI agent
- Evidence: Run #19 completed with 0 token usage
- Next: Begin systematic activation debugging

---

## Pattern Tracking

- Unexpected outcomes: 0/2
- Backtrack cycles: 0
- Time used: 0 minutes
- Velocity: HIGH TEMPERATURE MODE

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Navigation commands will be provided each step

### Step 1: trace-api-key-propagation ‚è≥

- Branch: step-1-trace-api-key-propagation
- Commit: 5a2083b043291253f47637ad5ddde4363a24b4f9
- Time: 0833
- Status: ‚úÖ OUTCOME IDENTIFIED
- Outcome: UNEXPECTED - API key completely missing from container environment
- Evidence: Container env shows empty value for OPENROUTER_API_KEY
- Root Cause: Docker compose not passing env var from host to container
- Hypothesis: OPENROUTER_API_KEY env var exists in container but isn't reaching the Roo Code extension process
- Expected: Find exact point where API key propagation breaks in chain: host ‚Üí container ‚Üí CLI ‚Üí VS Code ‚Üí extension
